I am attempting to conceptualize an experimental online queer chatbot experience that explores the affective potentials of human-nonhuman mediated digital encounters. Embedded in my project is the glitch, the uncanny intrusions that break the seamlessness of the immersive experiences that are advertised to us. My object of study is the online chatbot experience, and how I might be able to envision a hypothetical chatbot that is advertised specifically for queer women, and what digital, physical, and affective glitches might naturally arise from such an experience, and how I myself can construct glitches for the express purposes of attempting to present opportunities for generative experiences for the user. I want to explore both the degradation of the code of the chatbot platform, as well as the degradation of the relationship developed between the user and the bot (I explain my digital techniques below). I will be specifically calling upon Donna Haraway’s "A Cyborg Manifesto" to realize the post-human potentials of cyber-feminism, to extend beyond current and past conceptions of the 'fembot' as made in Man's image, such as in Her and Ex Machina. I will be referencing Legacy Russell’s "Digital Dualism and the Glitch Feminism Manifesto" to contextualize the use of the glitch within user-interactive experiences, especially as related to queer and feminist digital experiences, as not simply a subversive act, but a productive and generative one that offers new experiences and emotions to interrogate.

Due to the time constraints and scope of this project, I will not be creating a fully realized and functional chatbot, but rather use the digital storytelling tool Twine to create a prototype of the potential narratives through a "choose-your-own-adventure" story using hyperlinks, and customize it using HTML and CSS, to examine the visual aesthetics of current chatbots, and envision what an experimental queer chatbot could look like and how it would operate. Much of my approach to the chatbot aesthetics will at first take on the familiar aesthetic many corporations take when attempting to market to LGBT consumers, but the interface will experiences glitches that reveal a darker, grittier, cyberpunk aesthetic that perhaps can be associated with the counter-culture of early Web subcultures. In addition to Twine, I will be creating a website (either from scratch, or using WordPress, depending on my level of customizations) to curate a remixed, recombinatory collage of visuals, audio, text, to digitally show my research and inspirations. The narrative choices the user can make will trigger both specific and random glitches. In terms of glitches, I'm considering first introducing "typical" flaws in the experience: broken links, images slowly loading or not loading at all, pop-ups that are ads or NSFW images (to recreate the early internet aesthetic), and glitched images and videos. Slowly, I want the glitches in the code to be reflected in the user's engagement with the chatbot, to perhaps reflect a degrading relationship in more ways than one. Inspired by Toni Dove's Sally or the Bubble Burst interactive CD-ROM experience, I was inspired by the function that allows the user to select the tone of Sally's responses and her facial expressions. I wonder, could a glitch arise from the user no longer being in control of such features? Can the bot deny those selections, and instead act in a way of their choosing? This also harkens to narratives in science fiction of robot rebellion, of humanities creations breaking free from their masters, and I feel this could be a potentially explore the affective, emotional side of that story, and explore a cyborg that doesn't necessarily seek liberation, but is simply reflecting the emotional states of the users interacting with it. In this way, while the format will be choose-your-own-adventure (in this prototype), all roads will lead to glitch, breakdown, and eventual destruction of the chatbot, to signal that we are not always in control.
